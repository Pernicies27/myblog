I am dedicated to making the biggest difference in the world I possibly can through [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/).
Currently, I aspire to positively shape the long-run impacts of Artificial Intelligence by either doing research myself
or by taking on a Governance role

As of now, I am a student of Computer Science and Mathematics at RWTH Aachen University in Germany. 
I will finish my Bachelor degrees until March and am curious what I will make out of my future.

In my freetime, I lead the [Effective Altruism Aachen](https://ea-aachen.org) student society. 
The project I am most excited about is a semester-long university module we offer in cooperation with RWTH Aachen University.
